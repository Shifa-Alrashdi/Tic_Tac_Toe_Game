# Tic Tac Toe Game
The Tic-Tac-Toe game (also called Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os) can be linked to historic Egypt. It is a global and popular game. Itâ€™s for two players who alternately use the X or O to designate the spots in a three-by-three grid. The winner is the player who successfully arranges three of their marks in a row that is either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
